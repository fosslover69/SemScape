# Motto of SemScape


The main goal of SemScape is to reduce the friction experienced by students while learning and preparing for semester exams. The name "Sem-Scape" reflects this goal - to provide an escape from the pain of semesters. Many institutions have their own syllabi and patterns for their semesters, making it difficult for students to find relevant materials online. SemScape aims to solve this problem by providing a personalized and centralized place for institutions to manage study materials.


# How does SemScape achieve this?

One of the key benefits of open source projects is that anyone can fork the code and use it for their own needs. Since SemScape is open source, anyone from any institution can fork the code and host it themselves, as it will be published under the GPL (GNU General Public License).


# How does SemScape work?

SemScape is primarily focused on serving colleges and universities. Students will be able to view or download a list of courses and subjects from the site. Behind the scenes, a selected group of contributors from the institution (either faculty members or students) will upload materials and resources for public use.


# Technical details for tech-savvy users

SemScape is an open source project that I am building primarily for the purpose of learning and having fun. It will be built using Svelte (a front-end framework) and Supabase (an open source Firebase alternative). As mentioned earlier, SemScape will be published under the GPL.
